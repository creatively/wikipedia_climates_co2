This js code snippet calculates the approximate annual CO2 emissions for a household's heating/cooling needs
It uses the existing climate tables for a town/city to calculate the likely heating/cooling needs for each month's temperature.

When the js code is applied to js console on the Wikipedia's page's, it adds an extra line to the page's existing climate table, stating the place's approximate CO2 emissions per year.

------------------------------------------

This can be applied to any Wikipedia towns/cities page that has a climate data table that has a row of monthly 'mean' temperatures.
