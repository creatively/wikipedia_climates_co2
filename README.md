This code snippet calculates heating/cooling CO2 emissions for any town/city with a climate table on it's Wikipedia page.

An extra row is added to the location's climate data table, illustrating the approximate heating/cooling CO2 emissions for each month.

------------------------------------------

This can be applied to any Wikipedia towns/cities page that has a climate data table that has a row of monthly 'mean' temperatures.
