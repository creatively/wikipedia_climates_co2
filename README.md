On Wikipedia town/city pages, this code uses the mean temperature of months already in the page's climate table 
to calculate estimated co2 emissions from heating or air-con energy useage per average household.

It then adds a line to the page's existing climate table, stated the place's calculated CO2 emissions figure.

------------------------------------------

This can be tested on any Wikipedia page with a location's climate data table that contains a row of monthly 'mean' temperatures, by :
Click F12 ...
Click the resulting "Console" tab ...
Paste in the code from this project's "main.js" file ...
Press enter ...
The new row of the estimated CO2 emissions is now visible near the bottom of the table
