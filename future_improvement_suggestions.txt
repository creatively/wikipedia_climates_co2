NEXT TASKS / BUGS:
==================
(---Now all completed---)
> Minor bug, where final html text appears in developer Console's log rather than just the table


POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS :
===============================

> Make the "/35"  [ HEATING/COOLING SCORE --> CO2 EMISSIONS ]  factor more accuarte
    by using  place<-->co2  data from countries beyond the USA
> Potentialy improve the "18C" midpoint, by checking for higher correlation coefficients using other midpoint numbers
    note that : "18C" is commonly used in the USA as the midpoint to calculate heating & cooling 'degree eddays' amongst engineers
                "15.5C" is commonly used in the UK
> For Wikipedia climate tables with 'max' & 'min' numbers available but not 'mean' (eg. "Imphal" city) 
    create a function to average the 'max' & 'min' numbers into likely 'means'
> The current scores assume that air-con & heating use the same amount of energy per degree,
    so a validated weighting factor would help address that and improve accuracy of the resulting CO2 figure
> Average household CO2 emissions are also influenced by income levels. GDP figures are often also included on a Wikipedia place page, and could be 'grabbed' and factored in.
> Differences in energy sources between countries
